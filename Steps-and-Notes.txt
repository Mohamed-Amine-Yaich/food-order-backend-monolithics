 yarn/npm init :  start a node project by creating a package.json file  in the current dir 
 tsc init  : Created a new tsconfig.json
 adding couple of node dependencies : express nodemon body-parser cors ts-node-dev typescript @types/express @types/cors

 express: node js framework and a robust tooling for creating http servers 
 nodemon: helping tool during development that keep restarting the server(node app) when file changes  
 body-parser: is a middleware library used in node js app,  parse incomming http request body in a more convenient format for your app to work with.
